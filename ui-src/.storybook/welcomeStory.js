    ## Building Holochain hApps
    **This is how we do it**
    (Processes for getting to a "let's build it" and then building it are coming soon with Errand.)

    1. Write a Story in Storybook for each state of the component
      - eg Add, Edit, List
    1. Write Notes in Mark Down to describing the story.
    1. As you think of things to verify write them down with intentional test names as Specs
      - We aim for [contravariance with tests.]('http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2017/10/03/TestContravariance.html')
    1. Update Sketch tab to show new design of UI
      - needs our new Storybook addon coming soon
      - for now we reference the designs through Sketch
    1. Write prototype steps in Cypress
      - Would be cool to finish the loop and generate Sketch prototypes from Cypress.

    ### Abundance of Presence
    This app also includes a feature that is part of the dogfooding approach being taken by the Holo(chain) team.

    We all struggle with the ability to schedule time to meet while being a fully distributed team in many timezones. We are proposing a new approach to "Finding Time."

    You can view our [brainstorming Realtimeboard](https://realtimeboard.com/app/board/o9J_kzK8i00=/) and provide feedback by submitting tickets to this repo.

    Check out our [Storybook](https://holochain.github.io/holochain-ui/index.html?selectedKind=HoloVault%2FPersona&selectedStory=New%20Persona&full=0&addons=1&stories=1&panelRight=0&addonPanel=storybook%2Fnotes%2Fpanel) to test how the components of the app operate. By taking this approach we are sharing the ability for developers to apply these well documented concepts into other holochain apps.
