## Features
Allows one to bridge different holochain services and manage different personas that provide a way to build unique profiles for whatever hApp will be used.

This app brings together the features of [HoloChat](https://github.com/holochain/holochat) and [HoloVault](https://github.com/holochain/holo-vault) into one extensible user interface.

### Abundance of Presence
This app also includes a feature that is part of the dogfooding approach being taken by the Holo(chain) team.

We all struggle with the ability to schedule time to meet while being a fully distributed team in many timezones. We are proposing a new approach to "Finding Time."

By taking this approach we are sharing the ability for developers to apply these well documented concepts into other holochain apps.
